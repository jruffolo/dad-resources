                <h1>Hi dad!</h1>
                <p>I hope that you find some of these resources useful. 
                    I created this website as a home base that you can visit to access information and helpful tools.
                    We can adjust it over time to better suit your needs.
                    If you need help setting anything up or finding something new, I am always here to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't forget that we are with you every step of the way!<br><br>Love,<br>Joshua

                    <li><a href="https://www.languageguide.org/english/vocabulary/">Language Guide</a> <br>A simple website with a good representation of common words separated by category.
                    Could be very useful to find the right word you're looking for, but also to practice with its speaking challenges.
                    Navigate to a category and hover over / click on the picture to see the word and play its corresponding audio file.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.esolhelp.com/online-picture-dictionary.html">ESOL Online Picture Dictionary</a> <br>An old website made for language learners.
                        Has many different categories with common words, including an "actions" category which the other dictionaries lack. 
                        Unfortunately it constantly prompts you to download Adobe Flash player which you have to dismiss each time.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.ikonet.com/en/visualdictionary/">Ikonet Visual Dictionary</a> <br>A very detailed dictionary with many subcategories. 
                        Somewhat scientific and maybe too complex to use quickly, but it still could be useful. Old website, works better on desktop than mobile.
                        There is a paid app version available to download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/merriam-webster-the-visual/id963177153">here</a>
